blackjack.py is a description of game realization. Could be used to check the rules of the game.

Currently, dealer++.py consists an algorithm to calculate distribution of probabilities for dealer to get total of 17-21 or 22 (when dealer get more than 21) on each stage)

Folder js contains the port of dealer++.py to Javascript (thanks, Serg!)
